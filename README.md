The program should calculate an entry fee for each player. This calculation should take
into account the skill level of the player.
The system should display the fee in the appropriate currency, using these exchange rates:
• £ sterling for all UK players; no exchange rate required
• £1 = 1.50 US dollars
• £1 = 2.00 AU dollars.
The entry fee will consist of:
• £10 per player
• an additional fee of £35 for ‘Expert’ players or £20 for ‘Casual’ players.
Fee calculator requirements
• The fee calculator should start with a welcome message.
• It should ask the user for the player’s:
• email address
• skill level (E for expert, C for casual)
• country (UK, US, AU).
• It should then calculate the entry fee.
• The fee should be displayed in the correct currency, using the following
abbreviations: USD, AUD, GBP.
• It should then ask if the user wishes to calculate another fee.
